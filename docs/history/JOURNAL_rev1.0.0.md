## 2026-10-10 UTC — RV-M1.1-001 / RUNTIME-BASELINE

Actor: Codex. Repository baseline: ppow1/Riverview-, branch work,
`7dd9d472ad3c44ea71f2914392dd2696943c943b`, initially clean. Loaded full campaign,
roadmap, AI hints, lifecycle/records/DoD and all checked-in architecture/component
and privacy contracts. Issue #1 API retrieval denied by the egress proxy; browser
path returned 404, not proof that issue does not exist. Git read authentication
works. No issue text has been claimed as read.

Decision: follow checked-in M1.1 assignment and the user's supplied Camrui
configuration; introduce only new revision-1.0.0 files. No controlled predecessor
is overwritten; baseline tracked-file hashes are compared before final handoff.
Deployment helpers preserve exact existing unit bytes/checksum and release link
before replacement; rollback remains live NOT VERIFIED.

Existing database readiness evidence is reused. Remote development checkout
`/home/admin1/riverview-core` remains untouched; root-owned immutable runtime
releases under /opt avoid letting an unprivileged service modify its own code.
Use OS riverview identity distinct from DB riverview_core, systemd credential
delivery, read-only connection/schema diagnostics and freshness-aware consumers.
The request-driven baseline check does not weaken persistent execution or CME.

Experiment: normal cloud SSH stopped at unsafe installed system SSH configuration.
An isolated `ssh -F /dev/null` check with strict host-key checking and BatchMode
then returned connection refused to admin1@192.168.1.155:22. No remote operation
ran. User directed continuation via a Windows-transferable package; no credentials
were requested in chat. Camrui live tests remain NOT VERIFIED.

Development tests exercise simulated DB contracts, credential/identity failures,
stale/unavailable observers, package bytes/checksums and acceptance failure
retention. They do not prove PostgreSQL TCP authentication or systemd credential
delivery on Camrui. Direct systemd template verification failed solely because
the deployment interpreter path is absent locally; a temporary path substitution
is used for structural validation and reported distinctly.

Next: build exact committed package, provide evidence and PR when API access
permits. Execute Camrui commissioning via existing Windows SSH, capture outcomes,
resolve dependent DoD/Steward acceptance; keep roadmap cursor at M1.1.
